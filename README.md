## Why
In Obsidian, backlinks are typically visible only in the right panel or at the bottom of the file. This always bothered me, as I wanted a quick and easily accessible overview of incoming links (backlinks) and outgoing links. This plugin addresses that need by allowing you to have this information readily available at the top of your markdown files.

## Current features

As of the time of writing, this plugins is very simple and allows...

- showing backlinks and outgoing links in the headers at the top of your note.
- sticking the header to the top of the screen when scrolling
- other small customizable options

## Future planned features

- [ ] Fully customizable control to put any content in the headers
- [ ] Enable customizable colors for links
